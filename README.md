# Calculator
A simple 4 function calculator I made as I learn Python

My python code can be found inside Calculator/venv/Calculator.py

This is the first repository that I am uploading to github. I hope to become more proficient at navigating and utilizing git and github.

Attached is a screen capture of the calculator window in action!
